#| Script to install and configure Fusion Directory and supporting software in a
#| Debian Squeeze environment.
#|
#| WARNING::  This script is experimental.  It would be best to use this
#| script as documentation and perhaps cut/paste and run small sections.
#| It assumes an LDAP server will be newly installed on the same box as Fusion
#| Directory.
#|
#| Summary of installation steps :
#| 0) Check we're root and that we have a real IP before we get started. ;)
#| 1) Install the latest Fusion Directory from the repository, and some other
#|    required software such as Apache2, php5 and the Slapd LDAP server.
#| 2) Modify our PHP configuration with changes Fusion Directory requires.
#| 3) Generate encryption keys and certificates.
#| 3) Set up TLS encryption on our LDAP server using the keys and certs to
#|    protect any sensitive data that travels to/from the server over the
#|    network.
#| 4) Install some schemas into our LDAP server config.  A schema tells our
#|    LDAP server the format of the data we want it to store.
#| 5) Configure apache to allow https so we can remotely connect to the
#|    Fusion Directory GUI more safely.
#| 6) Restart slapd and apache so we can log in and begin configuring Fusion
#|    Directory through its GUI.

#|
#| TLS is a type of public-key cryptography.  I accidentally wrote an essay on
#| this, so if you already know what it is feel free to skip the following
#| LOOOONG explanation :
#'------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FIXME: TLS is obsolete.  We should encrypt connections differently. A pointer from IRC:
# <pav5088> How does one enforce an encrypted connection to OpenLDAP (other than insisting on an ldaps:// connection?).
# <pav5088> I guess ldaps is depricated?
# <hyc> see the "security" and "requires" directives in slapd.conf(5)

#!!!! BEGIN EXPLANATION OF PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#!
#! Cryptography is the science of encoding messages so they are hopefully
#! unreadable to anyone except the entity the message is meant for.
#! Understanding public-key cryptography is useful.  Net banking and lots of
#! other sensitive business on networks is kept safe using this technology, and
#! if you know how it works you can better avoid the bad guys.  Learning about
#! sending secret messages is interesting in its own right anyway.
#!
#! Public-key cryptography relys on the use of "asymmetric key"
#! algorithms.  It's important to understand what this term means, so I'll
#! explain it by contrasting it with a common "symmetric key" algorithm that
#! kids often use to send secret messages.
#!
#! An example of a very simple symmetric key algorithm is the Caesar cypher.
#! Once used by Julius Caesar to send messages to his generals it is now often
#! used by children to send secret messages.  It involves shifting each
#! letter of a message a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.  eg.
#! for a shift of three : "A" would be replaced by "D", "B" would become "E",
#! "message" would become "phvvdjh" etc.  This kind of algorithm is called
#! "symmetric" because the "key" (ie. number) used to decrypt the message is
#! closely related and often identical to the key used to encrypt. In our
#! "Caesar cypher" example the number we use to decrypt the message (ie. -3)
#! is easy to discover from the number used to encrypt the message (ie. +3).
#! NOTE WHAT THIS MEANS:: We need to keep the encryption key (ie. +3) a
#! secret because anyone who knows it can easily work out the decryption
#! key (ie. -3) and read our message!
#!
#! "Asymmetric" algorithms on the other hand rely on some very strange
#! mathematics(*) - the number used to decrypt a message is very difficult (and
#! hopefully practically impossible) to discover even when someone knows the
#! number used to encrypt it.  It's not important to understand the maths,
#! but it IS important to understand the useful implication - our messages are
#! kept secret even if the world knows our encryption key!  We can share
#! our encryption (or "public") key with the world and people can use it to
#! encrypt messages which only we can decrypt - provided we keep our decryption
#! or "private" key secret.  They CAN'T use the "public" key to discover our
#! secret "private" key and (for example) decrypt messages other people have
#! encrypted for us using our public key.  NOTE:: This is why this kind of
#! cryptography is called Public-Key cryptography.
#!
#! We therefore need to distribute our public key so others can send us
#! encrypted messages, but they need to be sure the public key really belongs
#! to us.  There are two concepts that are useful for this - digital signatures
#! and certificates.  Just as in the real world signatures can be used to sign
#! certificates, and I will explain these two concepts in the following
#! paragraphs.
#!
#! Digital signatures : In real life a signature on some information means the
#! owner of the signature approved the information.  To digitally "sign"
#! something we mathematically "apply" our private key to the data using
#! software.  This process generates a "digital signature" which is really just
#! a big number.  We send this number along with the data, and this allows the
#! recipient to verify it was signed by our private key (provided they have our
#! public key and the right software).  The signing proves the data is from us
#! (unless someone stole our private key, or we gave it to someone to act on
#! our behalf).
#!
#! Digital certificates : Because anyone with the right software can create
#| a public/private pair of keys the "digital certificate" was invented as
#| a way of certifying who a particular key belongs to (eg. a bank).
#| Certificates are digitally signed documents that contain four pieces of
#| information :
#! 1) a public key,
#! 2) the identity/details of who this public key belongs to,
#! 3) a digital signature from someone vouching that the public key really
#!    belongs to the identity on the certificate.  (IMPORTANT: we need to
#!    ask ourselves if we trust who signed this certificate), and
#! 4) the length of time the certificate should be considered valid.
#!
#! How do we know which digital signatures to trust?  In some cases the writers
#! of software decide this for you.  Web browsers for instance trust many
#! Certificate Authorities (CA's) - companies such as Verisign and Thawte who
#! are in the business of verifying and signing off on identites.  Banks and
#! other secure sites will often get their certificates signed by these CAs so
#! that web browsers will automatically trust them.  If a certificate has NOT
#! been signed by an entity your browser already trusts then you will get a
#! warning and an option to continue anyway - it's then up to you if you trust
#! the site or not.
#!
#! Opinions differ on the value of trusted certificates.  You have to trust
#! that the CA companies won't (accidentally or otherwise) issue certificates
#! to the bad guys, or a CA issued certificate hasn't been stolen to fake
#! data as having come from the certificate owner.
#!
#! * - regarding the "strange mathematics" used in public key cryptography :
#|     Factorisation of "semiprimes" is an example of asymmetric mathematics.
#|     A semiprime is the product of two prime numbers.  Finding two large
#|     primes and multiplying them together is simple, but working the opposite
#|     way ie. finding the original factors APPEARS to be very very difficult.
#|     If anyone finds a more efficient method of factorisation then encryption
#|     methods based on factorisation will be considered weakened or broken
#|     (depending on the efficiency of the new method).
#|     
#!!!! END EXPLANATION OF PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#,------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#| SSL/TLS encryption can either use a "self-signed" certificate, or a
#| certificate digitally signed by a third party.  It's possible to use a
#| self-signed certificate here...  but these can cause warnings/errors in
#| some situations, and some advanced features such as CRL's (certificate
#| revokation lists) are only available when we have our certificate signed
#| by a third party ie. Certificate Authority (CA).  In this script we create
#| our OWN root CA, but we could also get a certificate issued by a CA company.
#|
#| A quick note for those not new to digital certificates :
#| Debian now compiles much of its software using the GNUTLS libraries and not
#| OpenSSH.  I had better luck getting certificates generated by certtool
#| (the GNUTLS certificate generation tool) rather than the openssh tool.
#|
#| When generating certificates certtool requires details in the form
#| of a "template" file.  A certificate can contain a lot more information
#| than the barest basics I've included here. eg. Country, state, extra
#| config options etc...  The expiration_days setting sets how long your certs
#| will be valid for.  crl_signing_key allows your key to be used to sign
#| Certificate Revocation Lists (but I haven't investigated how this feature is
#| used myself).

#| Our LDAP server also needs to know the format of the data we need it to
#| store, so we include the required descriptions (or "schemas") in the
#| server config file.  This is done in the following way :
#| include <path to schema file>
#|
#| To improve search performance on certain attributes we also tell slapd to
#| maintain indexes on these attributes. Slapd indexes increase search
#| performance at the expense of memory and write performance.  This is only a
#| concern in larger directories, and/or heavily loaded servers.  Indexes are
#| of the form :
#| index <attribute/s> <index type/s>
#|
#| When tuning you will want to preferentially index the most searched attributes.
#| I have no idea what these are in Fusion Directory.  :)  The "index type/s"
#| describe what kinds of searches the index should support.  The three types
#| we will use are :
#|
#| 1) eq : searches of the form 'sn=smith' (ie. uses the EQUALITY rule only).
#|
#| 2) sub : substring or "wildcard" searches eg. 'sn=sm*' i.e wildcards are
#| included (uses the SUBSTR rule). This rule may be enhanced by a using
#| "subinitial" (optimised for 'sn=s*'), "subany" (optimised for 'sn=*n*') or
#| "subfinal" (optimised for 'sn=*th'). One or more sub parameters may be
#| included.
#|
#| 3) pres : searches for "presence" of an attribute.  Searches are in the form
#| 'objectclass=person', 'attribute=mail' etc...
#|
#| There are many other index types (eg. attrlist, special, approx), but
#| we don't use them so I'm not going to discuss them.

#| For security we should run our Fusion Directory GUI on a SSL enabled web

a2ensite default-ssl
a2enmod ssl

# We can now access Fusion Directory via https.  NOTE:: there are
# SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile directives in
# /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.
# These by default point to the snakeoil certs which we replaced earlier.
# I mention this in case you modify this script to use eg. purchased certs
# under different filenames - the Apache cert configuration will need to be
# modified in this case.
#
# If we wanted to ensure ONLY encrypted connections to Apache we could
# disable port 80 on Apache by editing /etc/apache2/ports.conf.
# Alternatively there's an option in the Fusion Directory config to force
# Fusion Directory to only use https : "Enforce encrypted connections" on the
# "Fusion Directory settings 3/3"
# page of the Fusion Directory setup.  If you want to change this later the
# option is forceSSL in fusiondirectory.conf.

# If there are issues with connecting to slapd you can try running slapd from 
# the commandline.  The -d switch specifies debugging...  specify the debug
# level required eg :

#| Backup instructions :
#| Fusion Directory's config lives in /etc/fusiondirectory/fusiondirectory.conf,
#| and slapd's config dir in
#| /etc/ldap/slapd.d.  These files can be fairly easily recreated, but it
#| wont hurt to back them up anyway.
#| FIXME: The following is obsolete info - slapd no longer uses slapd.conf -
#| you will need to modify this script : To backup the LDAP database you can
#| add the /usr/share/doc/slapd/examples/slapd.backup script to cron.  This
#| will write daily backups to /var/backups/slapd/ :
#|
#| cp /usr/share/doc/slapd/examples/slapd.backup /etc/cron.daily
#| chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/slapd.backup
#|
#| To restore make sure slapd is stopped, clean out any existing data ie. :
#| rm -R /var/lib/ldap/*
#| ...then use slapadd to load data from the ldif backup eg. :
#| slapadd -v -c -l backup.ldif -f /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
#| ...then run slapindex, and then start slapd
#| NOTE:: Any extra schemas must be installed in slapd's configuration ie. in
#| /etc/ldap/slapd.conf .  You either need to restore (if you backed it up) or
#| recreate (using this script?) this config file.
